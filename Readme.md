# php-with-databases

This project develops further on [basic-php-website](https://github.com/hortfrancis/basic-php-website) to include integration with a SQL database to display information about items in a media library, with pagination and a search bar. 

Created while following the [Intermediate PHP](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/intermediate-php) Treehouse track, while studying with Netmatters in October 2023.
